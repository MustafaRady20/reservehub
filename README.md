# Reservhub

A simple microservices backend built with **NestJS**.

This system handles:
- Reservations
- Payments (Stripe)
- User Notifications

Services communicate asynchronously using **RabbitMQ** and are designed to run in a containerized environment using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**.

More features and documentation will be added later.
